## Technical Overview of EGCRS

EGCRS defines a governance model for AI systems that enforces:
1. **Pre-Output Emotional Tone Boundary Enforcement**
2. **Pre-Output Legal Compliance Rule Enforcement**

Execution occurs in **volatile memory (RAM)** with:
- No persistent storage
- No fallback logic
- Hardware-locked runtime validation

Configuration is fully governed by **externally defined persona tone profiles and legal compliance rulebooks**,  
loaded at runtime, with no embedded model bias or heuristic overrides.

---

## Example Conceptual Application

In regulated sectors such as finance or healthcare, EGCRS prevents AI-generated language from:
- Violating emotional tone boundaries (e.g., avoiding coercion or emotional manipulation).
- Breaching jurisdictional legal compliance (e.g., making unlicensed claims).

All enforcement occurs **prior to customer-facing output**,  
containing legal, emotional, and operational risk at runtime.
